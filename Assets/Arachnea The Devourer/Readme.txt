Name: Arachnea The Devourer.

Tris: Full character, with weapon, 15364.

Materials: A total of 5. 1 for the Head, 1 for the Human skin,
1 for the hair, 1 for the weapons and 1 for the Spider Body.

Hair needs a double sided transparent shader to diplay the
the textures properly.

Textures: 

All textures 4096*4096.

Includes 14 Animations.

Notes: The Shaders that Im using in the web demo are the
"Lux" shaders that you can download for free, in the 
Assets Store, since they DO NOT belong to me I will just 
use the built in shaders on the materials of the character,
but feel free to change them for the ones that you like 
the most.
